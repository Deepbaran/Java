<!-- 
form tag has two methods GET and POST. GET is the default method. It is used to fetch data from the server. It appends the form-data in name/value pairs into the URL. Never use it to send sensitive data. GET is better
for non-secure data. On the other hand POST appends form-data inside the body of the HTTP request (data is not shown in URL).
The action attribute tells the form that this is the url where we need to submit the form to.

The name attributes of the tags are used to identify the the specific tags in the backend.
