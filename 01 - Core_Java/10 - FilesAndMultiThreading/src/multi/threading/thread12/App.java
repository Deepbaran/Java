/*
 * Callable and Future are two classes that enables you to get returnable from your threads
 * and they also allow your thread code to throw exceptions.
 * 
 * With simple Runnable, we are unable to return a particular value from a thread.
 * But with Callable we can.
 * 
 * Callable is a generic interface and the type we specify, us the type that we want to return.
 * 
 * Future is used to get the data that is returned by Callable. The type specified should be same as the type of the Callable.
 *
 * Future and Callable are a great way to use with ExecutorService (Thread pools) to add extra features and also some normal features that normal threads have (e.g: Interrupting).
