/*
 * Parent/Base/Super class -> inherited class
 * 
 * Child/Derived/Sub class -> inheriting class
 * 
 * Car does inherit all the data members of it's super class but we cannot access the private data members of the super class from the sub class
 * We know that Car inherited maxSpeed from Vehicle even though we cannot directly access it through Car object is because we can set the value 
 * and get the value of maxSpeed using getters and setters.
 * O, maxSpeed has to be inherited for it to be set and get. But Car can not directly access it.
 *
 * super -> super is Super class object
 * 
 * Just like "this" refers to the current object, "super" refers to the current super class
 *
 * So, even if there is a data member sub class which has the same name as a data member in the super class, we can access the data member in the
 * super class using "super". Otherwise the sub class data member would be called.
